			    Task 1 (Beginner Level):
Concepts used: control statements, conditional statements,

As now you all are familiar with at least 1 programming language. We want to let
you know the extreme reality that only theory wonâ€™t do anything you need to
practice your skills. Design a modern Calculator in any of the programming
languages but there are some basic requirements:

- Calc. should be able to do all basic functionality like addition , subtraction, etc.
- It should have functions like log , trigonometry too.
- Use of math libraries is strictly prohibited.
- It should also have an option to solve quadratic equations(Use its formula).

Some Ideas to make it better:
- Add functionality to solve n linear equations in n variables(at least for n = 2).
- Add functionality to solve differentiations and integrals.
